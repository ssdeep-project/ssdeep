	* Changed logic for reading files of known hashes to look for
	  the header this version of the program writes instead of 
	  the v1 header. This was done for the DC3 branch of the code.

	* Updated README documentation and published version 2.5.
	

2010-03-20 Jesse Kornblum

	* Fixed define in fuzzy.h to only allow one compilation
	

2010-03-19 Jesse Kornblum

	* Added 'extern "C"' definitions to fuzzy.h for C++ compatibility
	
	* Added return values indicating errors to API functions.

	* Modified sample program to use errors on return values
	
	* Added Doxygen documentation for API function.

	* Added inttypes.h include to fuzzy.h.

	* Added error checking for NULL strings in API functions.

	* Version bump to 2.5
	

2010-02-24 Jesse Kornblum

	* Experimenting with mode to compare unknown hashes to known
	  without comparing the unknown against each other.

	* Version bump to 2.4
	

2009-01-20 Jesse Kornblum

	* Added -a mode to display all matches regardless of score.
	

2009-10-11 Jesse Kornblum

	* Fixed typo in usage page.
	

2009-07-14 Jesse Kornblum

	* Fixed bug that prevented -x mode from working on Win32

	* Added web pages to trunk. Updated quickstart guide with 
	  automatic installation options and -x mode.

	* Version bump to 2.2 and updated man page, NEWS
	

2009-07-11 Jesse Kornblum

	* Cleaned up -x mode to compare two (or more) files of
	  signatures. 

	* Cleaned up some code comments and Remove Before Flight tags

	
2009-04-18 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Experimenting with -x mode to compare two (or more)
	  files of signatures

	* Added some parameter validation code

	
2009-01-01 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Added fuzzy_hash_filename function to hash a file given
	  its filename. This avoids issues passing FILE * structures
	  on Win32 systems in programs not using the fopen convention.
	  See feature request 2142005.

	* Reconfigured all files using latest autoconf tools
	

2008-09-23 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Reinstated the code to call match_pretty() at the end of
	  main. This lets the -p and -d modes to display output and
	  fixes bug 2124423.

	* Version bump to 2.1.

	
2008-04-06 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Updated man page to include -t and -c modes.


2008-03-04 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Made b64 variable static in fuzzy.c
	

2008-02-29 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Version bump to 2.0, reconfigured.


2008-02-22 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Changed reading of known hash files back to using
	  unsigned char values. This also required updating
	  the match_compare function to handle Unicode
	  characters when displaying match results.

	* Flipped files in Win32 zip file to have CR/LF 
	

2008-02-18 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Added man pages to the EXTRA_DIST Makefile variable.
	  Still need to reconfigure.

	* Added more documentation to the Windows zip file along
	  with the sample.c file

	* Removed extraneous recongfiguration from Makefile.am
	

2008-02-17 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Updated build system to create Win32 DLL, documentation,
	  and packages.

	* Added check in print_error functions to see if the state
	  is valid. 
	  
	* Updated documentation, usage message.

	* Added signature comparison example to sample program.
	

2008-02-16 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Removed block_size value from state variable. 
	  Nobody was using it.

	* Ammended API functions to support hashing either a buffer
	  or an open file handle

	* Moved ssdeep code into engine.c, moved fuzzy hashing
	  code into fuzzy.c. This will help us create libfuzzy
	  and fuzzy.dll.

	* Lots of cleanup to fuzzy hashing code. This includes removing
	  types like 'uchar' and replacing them with C99 types like
	  unsigned char. Less work for mother means less work debugging.

	* Moved definition of __progname to ssdeep.h. It's not being
	  used by the fuzzy hashing library and caused problems on OS X.

	* Brought over code to support Unicode from Miss Identify

	* Version bump to 2.0 beta1

	* Added sample program to demonstrate API features
	

2008-02-15 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Changing Win32 build to create DLL. All other
	  versions should have library/header files installed
	

2008-02-14 Jesse Kornblum 

	* Moved to autotools structure
