	  the v1 header. This was done for the DC3 branch of the code.

	* Updated README documentation and published version 2.5.

2010-03-20 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

2009-04-18 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

	* Experimenting with -x mode to compare two (or more)
	  files of signatures

	* Added some parameter validation code

2009-01-01 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

	* Added fuzzy_hash_filename function to hash a file given
	  its filename. This avoids issues passing FILE * structures
	  on Win32 systems in programs not using the fopen convention.
	  See feature request 2142005.

2008-09-23 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

	* Version bump to 2.0, reconfigured.

2008-02-22 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

	* Changed reading of known hash files back to using
	  unsigned char values. This also required updating
	  the match_compare function to handle Unicode
	  characters when displaying match results.
	* Flipped files in Win32 zip file to have CR/LF

2008-02-18 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

	* Added man pages to the EXTRA_DIST Makefile variable.
	  Still need to reconfigure.

	  and packages.

	  is valid.
	* Updated documentation, usage message.
	* Added signature comparison example to sample program.

2008-02-16 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

	* Removed block_size value from state variable.
	  Nobody was using it.
	* Ammended API functions to support hashing either a buffer
	  or an open file handle
	* Moved ssdeep code into engine.c, moved fuzzy hashing
	  code into fuzzy.c. This will help us create libfuzzy
	  and fuzzy.dll.
	* Lots of cleanup to fuzzy hashing code. This includes removing
	  types like 'uchar' and replacing them with C99 types like
	  unsigned char. Less work for mother means less work debugging.
	* Moved definition of __progname to ssdeep.h. It's not being
	  used by the fuzzy hashing library and caused problems on OS X.
	* Brought over code to support Unicode from Miss Identify
	* Version bump to 2.0 beta1
	* Added sample program to demonstrate API features

2008-02-15 Jesse Kornblum <research@jessekornblum.com>:

	* Changing Win32 build to create DLL. All other
	  versions should have library/header files installed
