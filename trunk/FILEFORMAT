SSDEEP FILE FORMAT VERSION 1.1

1. REVISION HISTORY

14 Aug 2006 - Initial version (jk)
15 Jul 2010 - Adding quotation marks to filenames



2. FILE HEADER

The first line of the file is a header, like this:

ssdeep,1.1--blocksize:hash:hash,filename

ssdeep - Identifies the file type
1.1    - The version of the file format, NOT the version of the program
--     - Separator

The remainder of the line identifies the format of the file. 
Note that for version 1.1 these values must be given EXACTLY as shown above


3. FILE DATA

Each line represents the hash of one file as listed in the header.
Specifically, we have the blocksize used by the program, the hash 
for this blocksize and twice the blocksize, and the filename. Filenames
are enclosed in quotation marks. Filenames which contain a quotation mark
will have those quotes slash escaped. For example, the file ma"in.c 
will be listed as: 

"ma\"in.c"
