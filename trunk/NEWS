** Version 2.2 - 22 Jul 2009

* New Features

  - Added capability to compare two or more files containing signatures
    against one another. 

* Bug Fixes

  - Changed default behavior to exit program on invalid command line flags


** Version 2.1 - 1 Jan 2009

* New Features

  - Added fuzzy_hash_filename function to hash an entire file given
    only its filename. Avoids issues on Win32 systems.

* Bug Fixes

  - Fixed -p mode to display output 




** Version 2.0 - 2 Apr 2008

* New Features

  - Created fuzzy hashing API/DLL
  - Added support for filenames with Unicode characters on Win32
  - Added threshold mode
  - Added CSV mode

* Bug Fixes

  - Fixed extra characters appearing during verbose mode




** Version 1.1 - 14 Aug 2006

* New Features

  - First public release
  - Added verbose mode to display filenames as they're being hashed
  - Added -d mode to make finding similar files in the same directory tree
      both easier and faster. Removes the need for two command lines and
      many extraneous lines of output.
  - Added -p mode to improve -d mode. Prints bi-directional matches together
    and omits self matches.
  - Added LARGEFILE_SOURCE define to Linux version to allow processing
    of large files. (You never know...) 

* Bug Fixes

  - Fixed cosmetic errors in usage message. Updated man page.




** Version 1.0 - 31 Mar 2006

* New Features

 - Released internally
 - Added silent mode, -s. All error messages are suppressed.

* Bug Fixes

 - Fixed failure to close files after reading in engine.c
 - Fixed routine to read headers of matching hashes on Windows.
 - Fixed handling of symbolic links
 - Fixed cosmetic bug to display error messages if file open fails
     (e.g. Permission denied, etc)
 - Removed quotation marks from the signatures but not the file names.
     Filenames may contain spaces, but signatures may not. Two bytes
     per line adds up when we starting compiling large hash sets.
 - Redirected all error messages to stderr instead of stdout
 - Removed duplicate defines at the start of engine.c
 - Replaced all references to u32 with C99 standard uint32_t
 - Added error checking for memory allocation in main.c:main() and
     engine.c:hash_file()
 - Removed useless logical AND of 0xFFFFFFFF from rolling hash update



** Version 0.1 - 4 Nov 2005

* New Features

 - Proof of concept
 - This version supports recursion, relative and bare file names, and
     can perform positive matching using a previous output.
