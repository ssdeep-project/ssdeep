<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<p>
Computes a signature based on context triggered
piecewise hashes for each input file, also called a fuzzy hash. If requested,
the program matches those signatures against a file of known signatures
and reports any possible matches.  It can also examine one or more files
of signatures and find any  matches in those files. Output is written to
standard out and errors to standard error. The program only accepts the
first 100MB of data presented via standard input. 
<p> 
<dl>

<dt><b>-m &lt;file&gt;</b> </dt>
<dd>Loads the specified
file of known hashes to be used for matching. This file must be a previous
output of the program. The program then hashes each entry in FILES and compares
these signatures to the known signatures.  Any matches which score above
the threshold are displayed.  This flag may be used multiple times to load
more known signatures. This flag may not be used with the -k or -x flags. 
<p>
</dd>

<dt><b>-k &lt;file&gt;</b> </dt>
<dd>Load the specified file of known hashes to be used for matching.
This file must be a previous output of the program. The program then treats
each entry in FILES as a set of known hashes as well. The hashes in these
FILES are compared to the known hashes from this file. Matches which score
 above the threshold are displayed. Both the file specified here and the
input FILES should contain fuzzy hashes.  This flag may be used multiple
times to load more known signatures. This flag may not be used with the
-m, -d, or -p flags. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-v</b> </dt>
<dd>Verbose mode. The name of each file is printed to standard
error as it is being hashed. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-d</b> </dt>
<dd>Computes a signature for each entry in the
FILES and compares it to the set  of known signatures. Matches which score
above the threshold are displayed. The computed signature is then added
to the set of known signatures. This flag may not be used with the -k or
-x flags. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-p</b> </dt>
<dd>Works like the -d flag, but displays all matches for each file.
That is, for two files A and B which match score above the threshold, displays
"A matches B" and "B matches A".  This flag may not be used with the -k or
-x flags. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-r</b> </dt>
<dd>Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed. Please
note that recursive mode cannot be used to examine all files of a given
file extension. For example, invoking the program with <b>-r *.txt</b> will examine
all files in directories that end in .txt.  If you want to process all files
in a directory tree with the .txt suffix, try using the <a href='find.1'><b>find(1)</b></a>
 command.

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-g</b> </dt>
<dd>Similar files are grouped together into clusters. This can be handy for
finding more similar files. That is, if you are searching for file A, which
matches B, anything which matches B will also be included in  the cluster.

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-s</b> </dt>
<dd>Silent mode. All error messages are suppressed. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-b</b> </dt>
<dd>Enables bare mode. Strips
any leading directory information from  displayed filenames.  This flag
may not be used in conjunction with the <b>-l</b> flag. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-l</b> </dt>
<dd>Enables relative file
paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for each file, displays the
relative file path as indicated on the command  line. This flag may not
be used in conjunction with the <b>-b</b> flag. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-c</b> </dt>
<dd>Enables comma separated output
mode. In any of the matching modes -d, -p, or -m, displays the results as input
file, known file, matching score. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-x</b> </dt>
<dd>Signature file matching. Each entry
in FILES must contain signatures generated by a previous output of the
program. Each signature is loaded and compared against the set of known
hashes. Match scores above the threshold are displayed. Each signature is
then added to the set of knowns.  This flag may not be used with the -m,
-d, or -p flags. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-a</b> </dt>
<dd>Displays all matches in any of the matching mode, regardless
of score. Using the -a flag displays all results, even if the match score
is zero. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-t &lt;val&gt;</b> </dt>
<dd>In any of the matching modes, only display matches when
match score is greater than the given value. The default threshold value
is zero. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-h</b> </dt>
<dd>Show a help screen and exit. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-V</b> </dt>
<dd>Show the version number and exit.

<p> 
<p> </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Return Value</a></h2>
Returns 0 on success, 1 if there is a problem. Read errors,
permission denied, and encountering directories while not in recursive
mode are still considered successes. Problems are things like being unable
to load the matching file, specifying both bare and relative paths, etc.
