.SH NAME
ssdeep - Computes context triggered piecewise hashes

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssdeep [-V|h] [-m <file>] [-vrpdsbl] [FILES]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes a checksum based on context triggered piecewise hashes
for each input file. 
If requested, the program matches those checksums against
a file of known checksums and reports any possible matches. Output
is written to standard out and errors to standard error.
Input from standard input is not supported.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode. The name of each file is printed to standard error
as it is being hashed.

.TP
\fB\-m <file>\fR
Load the file of known hashes to be used for matching. This file must
be a previous output of the program and have the correct header. Displays
only those files that match a known file and what file they matched
against. Although filenames may not contain Unicode characters, they
can hold hashes with Unicode filenames.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed.
Please note that recursive mode cannot be used to examine all
files of a given file extension. For example, invoking the program with
\fB\-r *.txt\fR will examine all files in directories that end in .txt. 
If you want to process all files in a directory tree with the .txt suffix,
try using the \fBfind(1)\fR command.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Pretty matching mode. Computes signatures for all input files
and then display all matches between files. That is, if file A matches
file B, displays "A matches B" and "B matches A" but not "A matches A".
Each file's information is grouped and separated by newlines. 
This flag may be used with the \fB\-m\fR flag, but not 
the \fB\-d\fR flag.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Enables directory mode. In this mode, all of the FILES are examined
and a signature is computed for each. If the signature for any files
matches any of the previously computed signatures, a match is displayed
just like the \fB\-d\fR mode. This flag may also be used in conjunction
with the \fB\-m\fR mode, but with the \fB\-p\fR mode.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Silent mode. All error messages are suppressed.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Enables bare mode. Strips any leading directory information from 
displayed filenames. 
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \fB\-l\fR flag.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Enables relative file paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for
each file, displays the relative file path as indicated on the command 
line. This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \fB\-b\fR flag.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show a help screen and exit.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Show the version number and exit.


.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success, 1 if there is a problem.
Read errors, permission denied, and encountering directories while
not in recursive mode are still considered successes. Problems are
things like being unable to load the matching file, specifying
both bare and relative paths, etc.
