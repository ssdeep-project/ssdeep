.SH NAME
ssdeep - Computes context triggered piecewise hashes (fuzzy hashes)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssdeep [-m <file>] [-k <file>] [-vdprgsblcxa] [-t val] [FILES]
.br
.B ssdeep [-V|h] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes a signature based on context triggered piecewise hashes
for each input file, also called a fuzzy hash.
If requested, the program matches those signatures against
a file of known signatures and reports any possible matches. 
It can also examine one or more files of signatures and find any 
matches in those files.
Output is written to standard out and errors to standard error.
The program only accepts the first 100MB of data presented
via standard input.

.TP
\fB\-m <file>\fR
Loads the specified file of known hashes to be used for matching. This file must
be a previous output of the program. The program
then hashes each entry in FILES and compares these signatures to the known signatures. 
Any matches which score above the threshold are displayed. 
This flag may be used multiple times to load more known signatures.
This flag may not be used with the \-k or \-x flags.

.TP
\fB\-k <file>\fR
Load the specified file of known hashes to be used for matching. This file must
be a previous output of the program. The program
then treats each entry in FILES as a set of known hashes as well. The hashes in these
FILES are compared to the known hashes from this file. Matches which score 
above the threshold are displayed. Both the file specified here and the
input FILES should contain fuzzy hashes. 
This flag may be used multiple times to load more known signatures.
This flag may not be used with the \-m, \-d, or \-p flags.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode. The name of each file is printed to standard error
as it is being hashed.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Computes a signature for each entry in the FILES and compares it to the set 
of known signatures. Matches which score above the threshold are displayed. The
computed signature is then added to the set of known signatures.
This flag may not be used with the \-k or \-x flags.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Works like the \-d flag, but displays all matches for each file. That is,
for two files A and B which match score above the threshold, displays
"A matches B" and "B matches A". 
This flag may not be used with the \-k or \-x flags.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed.
Please note that recursive mode cannot be used to examine all
files of a given file extension. For example, invoking the program with
\fB\-r *.txt\fR will examine all files in directories that end in .txt. 
If you want to process all files in a directory tree with the .txt suffix,
try using the \fBfind(1)\fR command.

.TP
\fB\-g\fR
Similar files are grouped together into clusters. This can be handy
for finding more similar files. That is, if you are searching for file
A, which matches B, anything which matches B will also be included in 
the cluster.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Silent mode. All error messages are suppressed.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Enables bare mode. Strips any leading directory information from 
displayed filenames. 
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \fB\-l\fR flag.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Enables relative file paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for
each file, displays the relative file path as indicated on the command 
line. This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \fB\-b\fR flag.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Enables comma separated output mode. In any of the matching modes
\-d, \-p, or \-m,
displays the results as input file, known file, matching score.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Signature file matching.
Each entry in FILES must contain signatures generated by a previous output
of the program. Each signature is loaded and compared against the set of
known hashes. Match scores above the threshold are displayed. Each signature
is then added to the set of knowns. 
This flag may not be used with the \-m, \-d, or \-p flags.

.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Displays all matches in any of the matching mode, regardless of score.
Using the \-a flag displays all results, even if the match score is zero.

.TP
\fB\-t <val>\fR
In any of the matching modes, only display matches when match
score is greater than the given value. The default threshold value is zero.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show a help screen and exit.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Show the version number and exit.


.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success, 1 if there is a problem.
Read errors, permission denied, and encountering directories while
not in recursive mode are still considered successes. Problems are
things like being unable to load the matching file, specifying
both bare and relative paths, etc.
